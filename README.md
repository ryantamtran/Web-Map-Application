GEOG 458 Lab 3

This is the Web Map Application lab for GEOG 458. This includes two thematic maps, one is a choropleth map of the [COVID-19 rates] and the other is a proportional symbols map of [COVID-19 cases]. 

For the [COVID-19 rates] choropleth map, it uses the U.S county boundary shapefile downlaoded from the U.S Census Bureau along with population data from the 2018 ACS 5 year estimates in order to calculate the case rates per thousand residents.
